*Quote of the hour:*
> ### On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament]: "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.
>
> ~ *Charles Babbage*
